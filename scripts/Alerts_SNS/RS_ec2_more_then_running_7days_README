Certainly! Hereâ€™s a more polished and detailed version of the instructions:

This script sends a notification via email when the RS and EC2 instances are older than 7 days. Follow these steps:

1. **Create an SNS (Simple Notification Service) Topic:**
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the SNS service.
   - Click on "Create topic."
   - Choose the topic type (Standard or FIFO) and configure the topic settings as needed.
   - Click "Create topic."

2. **Create a Subscription:**
   - In the SNS dashboard, select the topic you created.
   - Click on "Create subscription."
   - Choose the protocol as "Email" and enter the email address where notifications should be sent.
   - Click "Create subscription."
   - Confirm the subscription by clicking on the confirmation link sent to your email.

3. **Deploy the Script:**
   - Copy the script that checks the age of RS and EC2 instances and sends notifications.
   - Place the script on your server where it will be executed.

4. **Schedule the Script:**
   - Use cron to schedule the script to run periodically.
   - Edit the crontab file by running `crontab -e` in your terminal.
   - Add an entry to execute the script daily (or as needed). For example, to run the script every day at midnight, add:
     ```shell
     0 0 * * * /path/to/your/script.sh
     ```
   - Save and exit the crontab editor.

Make sure to replace `/path/to/your/script.sh` with the actual path to your script. Adjust the cron schedule as necessary for your needs.
